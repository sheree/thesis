\caption[Plot of the diversity of \emph{Bacteria} and \emph{Archaea} from \citet{Wu2009}]{ Plot of the diversity of \emph{Bacteria} and \emph{Archaea} from \citet{Wu2009}. 
The diversity as shown by sequencing of 16S \acp{SSU} genes from the environment, from known organisms and from genomes is compared.
The inset shows the diversity encompassed from sequenced genomes before and after the Genomic Encyclopedia of \emph{Bacteria} and \emph{Archaea} (GEBA) sequencing project, which targets genomes for sequencing based on phylogenetic diverisity \cite{Wu2009}.
