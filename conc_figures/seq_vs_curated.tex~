\caption[Plot of sequencing cost, curated proteins and metagenomic publications from \citet{Temperton2012}]{Plot comparing sequencing cost, uncurated protein data, curated protein data and metagenomics publications from 2000 to 2012 from \citet{Temperton2012}.
Sequencing costs retrieved from 
\url{http://www.genome.gov./sequencingcosts/}.
Uncurated proteins were the total number of sequences in the UniProt TrEMBL database.
Curated proteins were the total the manually annotated entries in the SwissProt database.
Metagenomic publications were the total retrieved from PubMed using the search term `metagenomics'.
