\caption[Counts of microbial cells and \acp{VLP} by epifluorescence microscopy]{Counts of microbial cells and \acp{VLP} by epifluorescence microscopy down the water column of Ace Lake.
Error bars represent one standard deviation.
No \acp{VLP} were detected at 12.7 m depth and the value reported represent the detection limit of the counting procedure (\emph{i.e.} one \ac{VLP} detected in one field of view); the true number is likely tot be lower than this.
