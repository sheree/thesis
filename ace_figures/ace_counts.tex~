\caption[Counts of microbial cells and \acp{VLP} in Ace Lake]{Counts of microbial cells (blue) and \acp{VLP} (red) by epifluorescence microscopy along a depth profile of Ace Lake.
Error bars represent one standard deviation.
No \acp{VLP} were detected at 12.7 m depth and the value reported represent the detection limit of the counting procedure (\emph{i.e.} one \ac{VLP} detected in one field of view); the true number is likely to be lower than this.
