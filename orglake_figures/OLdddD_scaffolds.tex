\caption[Genomic maps of Organic Lake scaffolds containing the OL-dddD homologue]{Genomic maps of Organic Lake scaffolds containing the OL-dddD homologue. DddT and choline dehydrogenase had best \ac{BLAST} matches to \emph{Halomonas} sp. HTNK1 (\emph{Gammaproteobacteria}) and \emph{Hoeflea phototrophica} DFL-43 (\emph{Alphaproteobacteria}), respectively. The numbers represent base pairs. The sample depth and filter from which the scaffold was assembled is shown in parentheses beside the scaffold ID.}
