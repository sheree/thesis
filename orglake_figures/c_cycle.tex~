\caption[Vertical profiles of potential for carbon cycling in Organic Lake]{Vertical profiles of potential for carbon conversions for each size fraction in Organic Lake. The y-axis shows sample depths (m) and the x-axis shows counts of marker genes normalised to 100 Mbp of \textsc{DNA} sequence. The 0.1, 0.8, 3.0 \textmu{}m size fractions are shown as blue, red and green, respectively. Counts for marker genes for the same pathway or enzyme complex were averaged and those from different pathways were summed. For marker gene descriptions see \tabref{tab:KO_table} and Table S3.}
