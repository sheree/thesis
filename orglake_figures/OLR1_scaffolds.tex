\caption[Maps of OL-R1 rhodopsin-containing scaffolds]{Genomic maps of Organic Lake scaffolds containing the OL-R1 rhodopsin homologue. All genes surrounding OL-R1 had best \ac{BLAST} matches to \emph{Octadecabacter} (\emph{Alphaproteobacteria}) sequences. The scale below shows the number of base pairs. The sample depth and filter from which the scaffold was assembled is shown in parentheses beside the scaffold ID.}
