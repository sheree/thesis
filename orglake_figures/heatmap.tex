\caption[Heatmap and biclustering plot of the \acs{SSU} gene composition in Organic Lake]{Heatmap and biclustering plot of the \ac{SSU} gene composition in Organic Lake. Samples are shown according to size fraction (0.1, 0.8 and 3.0 \textmu{}m) and depth (1.7, 4.2, 5.7, 6.5 and 6.7 m). \ac{SSU} genes were classified to lowest taxonomic rank that gave bootstrap confidence $>$85\% until the rank of genus. \ac{SSU} gene counts were normalised and square root transformed. Taxa that comprised $<$2\% of the sample were not included.}
