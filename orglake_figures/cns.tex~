\caption[Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles in Organic Lake]{Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles in Organic Lake. Vertical profiles of potential for (\textbf{A}) carbon (\textbf{B}) nitrogen and (\textbf{C}C) sulphur conversions for each size fraction. The y-axis shows sample depths (m) and the x-axis shows counts of marker genes normalised to 100 Mbp of \textsc{DNA} sequence. The 0.1, 0.8, 3.0 \textmu{}m size fractions are shown as blue, red and green, respectively. Counts for marker genes for the same pathway or enzyme complex were averaged and those from different pathways were summed. For marker gene descriptions see Table S2 and Table S3. AAnP, aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis; rTCA, reverse TCA; WL, Wood-Ljungdahl; DNRA, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia; DSR, dissimilatory sulphate reduction; DMSO, dimethylsulphoxide; ASR, assimilatory sulphate reduction; DMSP, dimethylsulfoniopropionate.}
