%Discovery-driven or observation-driven vs hypothesis driven
%Antarctic lakes are exceptional ecosystems that contain microbial life adapted to extreme polar conditions and the local lake geochemistry.
Metagenomics has proven to be an effective way to map the diversity of Antarctic lake ecosystems and provide hints of how they work.
In combination with metaproteomics and abiotic parameters, in-depth descriptions of the ecosystem functions of Ace Lake and Organic Lake were achieved.
The most noteworthy contribution of these studies has been to describe taxa and microbial processes previously unknown to occur in these lakes, and from these descriptions, generate testable hypotheses of population and ecosystem level function.

\section{Summary of outcomes from this work}
%This has necessitated the development of new ways to extract biological inferences from complex datasets.
The overall objective of this thesis was to study Antarctic lake ecosystems using an integrative metagenomics-driven approach.
In order to do this, methods were developed in chapter \ref{ch:ace} to measure properties of the community that would work alongside metagenomic sequencing to piece together a comprehensive description of ecosystem structure and function.
An epifluorescene microscopy protocol was designed that makes use of 0.01 \textmu{}m pore-size \ac{PCTE} membrane filters.
Using this protocol, cells and \acp{VLP} were successfully visualised and enumerated along the depth profile of Ace Lake, and subsequently in Organic Lake.
The need to develop this method was due to the discontinuation of supply of Anodisc filters, which are the standard filter used for direct counts of \acp{VLP} by epifluorescence microscopy.
Although cell and \ac{VLP} densities are fairly basic properties of the community, their measurement nonetheless revealed surprising results, such as the lack of correspondence between turbidity and cell density in Organic Lake.

A bioinformatic pipeline for analysis of metaproteomic mass spectra was also developed in chapter \ref{ch:ace} that incorporated use of matching metagenomic databases for protein identification and spectral counting to estimate protein abundances.
When applied to the metaproteomic analysis of Ace Lake, this workflow resulted in a greater number of protein identifications than previous work using cross-species matching \cite{Ng2010b} and showed statistically significant functional differences between the strata of the lake.
It also described the functional capacity of dominant populations in the mixolimnion.
The elaboration of a conceptual framework incorporating genomic and functional data in the study Ace Lake laid the groundwork for the subsequent studies on Organic Lake.

In chapter \ref{ch:olv}, two near-complete \ac{OLPV} genomes and a complete \ac{OLV} genome were described.
Genomic analysis of \ac{OLV} indicated it was a new member of the virophage virus family, which obligately utilise a  giant `helper' virus to complete their replication cycle but impair their helper's infectivity in the process.
Comparison of \ac{OLV} and \ac{OLPV} genomes identified shared regions that suggest \ac{OLV} is a virophage of \ac{OLPV}.
The metaproteomic analysis identified capsids from both viruses confirming members of the population were actively replicating viruses and not, for example, accessory genetic elements.
The availibility of \textsc{DNA} sequences from the whole community meant the most likely host, \emph{Pyramimonas}, could be identified.
The inferred interaction of the \ac{OLV}, \ac{OLPV} and host was used to generate a model of their population dynamics that showed if \ac{OLV} acts as a `predator of a predator', this would lead to increased frequency of population cycling.
This was hypothesized to function in the Antarctic lake ecosystem as means to increase dissolved carbon release and secondary production over the summer season.
Potential relatives of the \ac{OLV} were also found in Ace Lake and other aquatic environments indicating virophage may play an influential role in other ecosystems.

In chapter \ref{ch:org} a profile of the Organic Lake microbial taxonomic composition and potential for nutrient cycling was determined.
The community was found to consist primarily of eucaryotic algae related to \emph{Dunaliella} and three heterotrophic bacterial genera: \emph{Marinobacter}, \emph{Roseovarius} and \emph{Psychroflexus}.
The suboxic bottom zone of Organic Lake additionally contained lower abundance populations of \emph{Firmicutes}, \emph{Deltaproteobacteria} and \emph{Epsilonproteobacteria}.
Examination of genes involved in carbon cycling indicated a net loss of carbon could occur as potential for fixation was lower than for respiration.
However, genes for photo- and lithoheterotrophic pathways linked to the dominant bacterial lineages were abundant; in particular \ac{AAnP} genes were much higher than in any other aquatic environment surveyed.
Use of energy sources apart from organic carbon was hypothesized to be a specific adaptation of the heterotrophic bacterial population to conserve carbon within the system.
The capacity for nitrogen cycling also showed a shift away from fixation and a predominance of recycling of reduced nitrogen compounds.
This was similarly hypothesized to function as a mechanism to limit nitrogen loss.
A targeted search for genes involved in \ac{DMS} conversions found an abundance of \ac{DMSP} lyase genes indicating lysis of \ac{DMSP} is the likely source of the high \ac{DMS} levels that has been detected in Organic Lake.
\ac{DMSP} lyase genes were linked to \emph{Gammaproteobacteria} and \emph{Alphaproteobacteria} indicating \ac{DMSP} is an important carbon and energy source for these bacteria.
Unlike marine environments, \ac{DMSP} lyase genes were more abundant than \ac{DMSP} demethylase genes. 
The only other metagenomes to show comparably high abundance of \ac{DMSP} lyase genes were other hypersaline environments suggesting the DMSP lysis pathway is favoured in high salinity systems. 
%We have used theory to guide our work.

\section{Possibile future work on Organic Lake}
%The work described in this thesis is part of a program that has pioneering the use of shotgun metagenomics and metaproteomics in Antarctic lakes \cite{Ng2010a, Lauro2011, Yau2011} and the Southern Ocean \cite{Wilkins2012b, Grzymski2012, Williams2012a, Williams2012b}.
To establish a picture of the biotic composition and function of Antarctic lake communities, an observation-driven approach was utilised that allowed for completely new discoveries about these systems to be made.
Bioinformatic pipelines and theoretical models to do this have now been established.
These can be applied to future, similarly observation-based studies of Ace and Organic Lakes to define how they change over time and test our existing models of lake function.
%Some expected outcomes and specifics involved in how these studies could be implemented are described below.
It is also clear that a systems level understanding of the lakes is bolstered by having well-characterised isolates related to members in the community.
Guided by the studies from this thesis, isolation and characterisation of key members of the community, such as \emph{Pyramimonas}, \ac{OLPV}, \ac{OLV}, \emph{Marinobacter} spp. and \emph{Roseovarius} spp. from Organic Lake, could be attempted in the future.
Other complementary techniques, such as single-cell and single-virus genomics and \ac{SIP}, hold promise for learning about specific populations in the community.
Some experiments that could be used to test specific hypotheses generated by the study of Organic Lake are discussed below, along their expected outcomes and implications.

\subsection{Organic Lake dynamics over time}
To establish a complete understanding of Organic Lake requires comprehensive descriptions of the microbial community over different time scales.
The next step forward would be to obtain metagenomic and functional data at other points in the year, particularly the winter, to determine how the microbial community copes with the large seasonal changes in temperature, light and ice-cover.
This can elucidate how the community sustains itself when the absence of light is expected to forestall phototrophic primary production.
%Furthermore, it can determine what stategies phototrophic organisms employ to survive during this period.
%\emph{Psychroflexus gondwanensis} in Organic Lake have been shown to peak in abundance during summer indicating certain populations fluctuate seasonally \cite{James1994}.
%However, population dynamics over the annual cycle is not well-understood.

Paired metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses of the coastal Southern Ocean from winter and summer found winter samples were dominated by active chemolithoautotrophs including sulphur-oxidising \emph{Gammaproteobacteria} and ammonia oxidising \emph{Crenarcheaota} \cite{Grzymski2012, Williams2012b}.
If the Organic Lake ecosystem reflects that of the coastal Southern Ocean, the small population of chemolithoautotrophic sulphur-oxidising \emph{Proteobacteria} are expected to become dominant in the winter.
Succession of the bacterial population by \emph{Crenarchaeota} is not expected to occur as no signatures for \emph{Crenarchaeota} or ammonia oxidation were present in Organic Lake.
Furthermore, if the model proposed for the Organic Lake nitrogen cycle, which avoids oxidised nitrogen forms holds true, we can expect ammonia oxidising microorganisms will not play a part in the community.
%Another possibility is that bacterial populations will simply become dormant over the winter, as seems to occur in Artic sea ice communities \cite{Collins2010}.
In this way, an `-omics' based analysis of Organic Lake community over an annual cycle will shed light on how robust our models of nutrient cycling and concepts of the taxonomic composition are.

Ideally, metagenomic analyses would be performed on samples taken over several time points in the year including the transition from ice-covered to melted.
In chapter \ref{ch:olv}, it was evident that there was a large change in the viral population between the November and December 2008 samples  that correlates with melting of the ice-cover. 
Samples in the summer spanning the complete transition from ice-covered to thawed would allow organisms and metabolic functions to be related back the effects of the summer melt.
These samples can also be compared back to the 2006 and 2008 samples to establish if there are interannual differences.
Long-term sampling of Southern Ocean coastal surface waters suggests the community has a reproducible annual cycle \cite{Murray2007}.
However, Organic Lake has been shown to be physically variable over a decadal time scale with changes in water level of $\sim$1 m leading to large changes in the water column structure \cite{Gibson1995, Gibson1996}.
Notably, the pycnocline in Organic Lake occurred at 5.7 m in 2008; much lower than 3.5 m where it first reported to occur in 1978 \cite{Franzmann1987b}.
If the lake completely mixes, this would challenge the oxygen-senstitive microbes and processes occurring in the deep zone.
The large physical changes suggests that the microbial community would similarly experience large interannual variability.
Metagenomic sequencing in a future summer season would provide data spanning several years thereby allowing detection of interannual similarities and differences.

Sampling intensively over a short time scale in the summer will allow us to test the three-species Lotka-Volterra model of the \ac{OLV}, \ac{OLPV} and host algae population.
In the model, the density of each population oscillates in a phase-shifted manner in the sequence: prey, predator and predator of predator.
By observing the natural dynamics of these populations, we can determine if they fit with the proposed model.
If they do fit, the observed population densities can be used to derive the parameters that govern the interaction.
Close observation of these three taxa can suggest if additional modifications to the existing model or alternative models would better fit the data.

\subsection{\acs{OLV} physiology and ecology}
Since the discovery of the \ac{OLV}, two other members of the virophage family have been reported that have afforded a new perspective on \ac{OLV}.
The first of these is the Mavirus (for Maverick virus) so named for its evolutionary relationship with the Maverick/Politon class of eucaryotic transposons \cite{Fischer2011a}.
Like Sputnik, Mavirus has an absolute requirement for a helper virus, \ac{CroV}, to replicate and is deleterious to its helper \cite{Fischer2011a}.
The other virophage reported was called Sputnik 2 (its genome is almost identical to Sputnik), but unlike Sputnik, it was found both as a separate genome and integrated in its helper lentille virus \cite{Desnues2012}.
These two virophage systems in culture are associated with heterophic protists making \ac{OLV} the only genomic sequence currently available for virophage affecting cosmopolitan phytoplankton species.
Therefore isolating \ac{OLV}, acquiring genomes of \ac{OLV} relatives in Antarctic lakes and determining fundamental properties of \ac{OLV} physiology and dynamics would contribute immensely to our understanding of the evolution and diversity of virophages in general and is highly relevant to other aquatic systems.

The evidence that Mavirus has the same `virophage' phenotype as Sputnik strengthens the inference that \ac{OLV} does as well.
This is in part because Mavirus and \ac{CroV} and quite divergent from Sputnik and mimivirus respectively, yet retain the same traits \cite{Fischer2010, Fischer2011a}, suggesting a common feature of the whole lineage.
Moreover, as both mimivirus and \ac{CroV} encode much of their transcriptional machinery, they do not localise to the nucleus during infection but generate the viral factory in the cytoplasm of their host \cite{LaScola2008, Fischer2011a}.
Sputnik and Mavirus replicate in the giant virus factory making use of helper virus' replication and transcription systems, not the host cell's \cite{LaScola2008, Claverie2009, Fischer2011a}.
In this way, the replicative strategy of the mimivirus lineage makes them vulnerable to virophages parasitising necessary resources during replication, which is a likely cause of reduced helper virus production \cite{Claverie2009, Fischer2011a, Fischer2011b}.
As \ac{OLPV} encodes all \textsc{RNA} polymerase subunits (see GenBank accession HQ704802), this is evidence that it replicates solely in the cytoplasm, thereby making it susceptible to a virophage.
A larger census of virophage and helper viruses would be able to show if virophages only associate with members of the \ac{NCLDV} clade that replicate in the cytoplasm.
Ultimately, definitive confirmation of a detrimental effect on the helper by \ac{OLV} co-infection is likely only possible by observing infection in culture.

Although Sputnik and Mavirus have similar effects on their helper viruses, their infection strategies appear different raising interesting considerations for \ac{OLV}.
%All three genomes have share homologues of the Sputnik V20 \ac{MCP}, V3 FstK-HerA DNA packaging ATPase and V9 putative cysteine protease but otherwise are quite divergent.
%Sputnik and Mavirus additionally share a the V13 primase/superfamily 3 helicase and the V14 Zn-ribbon domain containing protein.
%While Sputnik and \ac{OLV} share the V18/19 minor virion protein, V1 primase-polymerase containing protein and V21 hypothetical protein.
Mavirus can be independently phagocytosed by \emph{Cafeteria roenbergensis} in the absence of \ac{CroV} -- perhaps serving as a defence for the host in the case of \ac{CroV} infection \cite{Fischer2011a}.
In support of this, Mavirus possesses a retroviral-family integrase that is theorised to have been separately acquired as a way to stabilise the relationship between the ancestral Mavirus and its cellular host \cite{Fischer2011a} although as yet, Mavirus has not been reported to be integrated in \emph{Cafeteria roenbergensis}.
In contrast, Sputnik seems to associate directly with the fibrils that coat the mimivirus virion, not the host \emph{Acanthamoeba} cell \cite{Boyer2011}.
These two modes of infection, that is, a virophage-bearing host being infected by a giant virus \emph{vs}. a host being infected by a virophage-bearing giant virus, produces different selection pressures that would lead to distinct effects on the population dynamics in the environment.
Detection of complete \ac{OLV} genomes in the 0.8--0.1 \textmu{}m size fraction indicates it was captured in association with larger particles but does not distinguish how it is transmitted.

Determination of the mode of infection for \ac{OLV} would improve predictive modelling of \ac{OLV} driven impacts on algal blooms.
This could be achieved by observation of \ac{OLV}-\ac{OLPV} infections in culture.
However, recently developed methods for flow cytometric sorting to obtain \acp{SAG} or \acp{SVG} \cite{Martinez-Martinez2011, Allen2011} could be applied to Organic Lake water samples to study the mode of \ac{OLV}, \ac{OLPV} and host interaction.
For example, a sample population of single host algal cells could be fluorescence sorted and screened for the presence of \ac{OLPV} and \ac{OLV}.
At the same time, a sample population of single \ac{OLPV} particles could be sorted and screened for the presence of \ac{OLV}.
This could reveal if \ac{OLV} is able to associate with the host independently of \ac{OLPV} or \emph{vice versa}.
Examination of the infected algal cells could also establish fundmental properties of the algae and virus populations such as proportions of infected cells and proportions of \ac{OLPV} infections that include an \ac{OLV}.
As these methods are quite new, an experiment of this kind would require optimisation to successfully capture an adequate sample of infected cells and target giant viruses.
However, just obtaining \acp{SVG} would provide invaluable information on virus diversity and genetic content making it worthwhile pursuing as a complement to metagenomic sequencing.

A final consideration for \ac{OLV} and \ac{OLPV} dynamics is suggested by the discovery that Sputnik 2 can integrate into its helper lentille virus \cite{Desnues2012}.
Integration of Sputnik 2 is localised to a 352 bp region corresponding to the Sputnik V6 gene that encodes a collagen-like repeat-containing protein shared by Sputnik 2, lentille virus and mamavirus  \cite{Desnues2012}. 
\ac{OLV} and \ac{OLPV} share a homologous collagen-like repeat-containing protein that may similarly function as a site of integration.
As yet, the conditions and mechanism by which Sputnik 2 integrates is unknown.
Screening of metagenomic assemblies, \acp{SVG} or isolated \ac{OLPV} genomes for integrated virophages can determine if this occurs in the environment.
Integration of \ac{OLV} and \ac{OLPV} could have interesting evolutionary functions.
One possibility is that integration of virophages may function analogously to lysogeny in bacteriophages if integration leads to virophage inactivity.
In this scenario, virophages would integrate into their helper virus when helper virus densities are low to avoid driving their helpers to extinction.
On the other hand, if integration does not entail dormancy of the virophage, it could function as a means to ensure transmission.
In either case, evidence of integration can be found in future genomic studies of Organic Lake.

\subsection{Organic lake biogeochemistry}
The models of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycling in Organic Lake were constructed based on the presence and abundance of known marker genes  along with data of the lake's chemical properties.
As yet, metaproteomic analyses from the same samples have not been performed, but this would help corroborate the inferred pathways are active. 
Other inferrences of Organic Lake biogeochemical function can be specifically tested on organisms in culture, tested by measuring rates of reaction \emph{in situ} or supported with additional molecular and chemical analyses.

For the carbon cycle, it was hypothesized that \ac{AAnP} and rhodopsin mediated photoheterotrophy can conserve carbon for use in biosynthesis  reducing overall carbon loss.
The conditions under which \ac{AAnP} is active can be tested on related organisms in culture, for example \emph{Roseovarius tolerans} from Ekho Lake in the Vestfold Hills. 
It is already known for \emph{R. tolerans} constant dim light suppresses \ac{BchlA} production while darkness stimulates it \cite{Labrenz1999}.
\emph{R.tolerans}, or related isolates, can be grown under a larger range of conditions to determine when \ac{AAnP} becomes an active process.
This might include further varying light intensity and cycle duration; varying organic carbon concentration and oxygen concentrations.
To determine the contribution of light to growth, the difference in growth when \ac{AAnP} is active and when it is not can be compared.
Characterising \ac{AAnP} in a model isolate from a similar Antarctic lake can inform an understanding of how it functions in Organic Lake.
However, to gain an understanding of when \ac{AAnP} is active \emph{in situ}, levels of \ac{BchlA} at different points in the year can be measured to see it correlates with seasonal changes.
In the case of the influence of rhodopsin-mediated phototrophy on the Organic Lake system, the function of rhodopsins first needs to be characterised in the diverse organisms in which they are found to confirm they are indeed used in photoheterotrophic growth.
In marine \emph{Flavobacteria}, there is already evidence that light stimulates growth through the action of rhodopsins \cite{Gomez-Consarnau2007}.
The same experimental design used to establish this can be applied to \emph{Psychroflexus gondwanensis} isolated from Organic Lake, \emph{Marinobacter} sp. ELB17 and \emph{Octadecabacter antarcticus}, which are relatives of species found in Organic Lake.

In the model of the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen fixation was inferred to be negligible due to the high concentrations of ammonia while denitrification was assumed to be limited by low levels of oxidised nitrogen compounds and lack of potential for nitrification to regenerate them.
In these cases where rates of reaction were inferred to be slow although genetic potential for them exists, the reaction rates can be directly measured.
Nitrogen fixation and denitrification rates can be measured from Organic Lake water samples by incubation with $^{15}$N labelled substrates or acetylene block assays.
Similarly, it was inferred that carbon fixation rates from photosynthetic algae and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria were lower than respiration and fermentation based on genetic potential.
As mentioned previously, populations of chemolithoautotrophs may increase in the winter, potentially becoming signficant source of primary production.
Another consideration for the carbon budget is how sustained levels of chemolithoautotrophy throughout the year compares to the short burst of photosynthetic production over the summer.
Measuring rates of primary production by $^{14}$C incorporation at different points in the season can acertain if there truly is a shortfall in the carbon budget, estimate how large it is and pinpoint if the main source of primary production is from photo- or chemoautotrophy.

Both the carbon and nitrogen cycles were also constructed with the assumption that inputs are also negligible.
For instance, denitrification rates would be limited by low fixation coupled with low rates of nitrification.
Nonetheless, it is possible that sufficient nitrate inputs occur that would sustain denitrification thereby by-passing the need for endogenous nitrification.
Monitoring for presence of melt streams that might feed into Organic Lake and determining their chemical profiles can gauge the contribution of allochtonous carbon and nitrogen to Organic Lake.

The unusually high concentrations of \ac{DMS} in the bottom waters of Organic Lake were inferred to originate from bacterial lysis of \ac{DMSP}.
As \ac{DMSP} lyases have only been discovered fairly recently \cite{Todd2007, Curson2008}, they have only been characterised from a few isolates \cite{Todd2007, Curson2008, Curson2010, Todd2010, Curson2012}.
Confirmation that the homologues found in Organic Lake are indeed functional can be achieved by cloning into the expression vector system established by \citet{Todd2007} and assaying for \ac{DMSP} lyase activity.
This would also provide valuable insight into the \ac{DMSP} lyases that are most relevant to cold and hypersaline environments.

Although it was inferred that \ac{DMSP} lysis was the main source of \ac{DMS} in the bottom zone of Organic Lake, production of \ac{DMS} other by anaerobic pathways are also possible.
Furthermore, \ac{DMS} was inferred to accumulate due to slow rates breakdown in the bottom zone.
Incubating Organic Lake water samples with radio-labelled \ac{DMSP} and tracking production of volatile \ac{DMS} would confirm the lysis pathway is an active process and determine the rates of reaction.
Performing this assay on water from different depths could determine if concentration of \ac{DMS} is high in the bottom zone because it is being produced there at a higher rate.
A similar assay can be performed using labelled \ac{DMS} to show if \ac{DMS} can be broken down and if this differs with depth.
If the proposed model for sulphur cycling based on marker gene frequencies is correct, \ac{DMS} breakdown in the bottom samples should be slow or not occur.
While this experiment will not exclude the possibility that \ac{DMS} is produced by an alternative pathway, knowing the rates of \ac{DMSP} lysis and \ac{DMS} breakdown and the \ac{DMS} concentration in a sample can indicate the existence other sources of \ac{DMS} production.

Most of the Organic lake \ac{DMSP} lyase genes could be linked to a taxonomic group except the most abundant type, OL-dddD, which had indication of both \emph{Alpha}- or \emph{Gammaproteobacteria} origins.
Identifying the organisms involved in \ac{DMSP} lysis can be achieved with \ac{SIP}.
This would involve incubation of $^{13}$C-labelled \ac{DMSP} in Organic Lake water samples followed by sequencing of the labelled DNA.
Sequencing of the \ac{SSU} genes would determine which specific taxonomic groups were the main contributors to \ac{DMSP} lysis and screening for \ac{DMSP} lyase genes would identify which \ac{DMSP} lyase is involved.
Performing this experiment at different depths of the water column could determine if the same organisms are responsible for \ac{DMSP} lysis at different depths.
No marker genes yet exist for \ac{DMS} oxidation although it can be readily utilised as a growth substrate by diverse microorganisms \cite{Johnston2008}.
The same experiment can be performed using $^{13}$C-labelled \ac{DMS} to determine the taxa involved in breaking it down in different depths of the lake.
In conjunction with metagenomic sequencing, or flow sorting and \acp{SAG} of \ac{DMS}/\ac{DMSP}-degraders, the biochemical pathways involved in \ac{DMS} breakdown can then be reconstructed giving a more complete understanding of Organic Lake sulphur biogeochemistry.

\section{Perspectives on `-omics' approaches }
It was not so long ago that what could be called the second molecular revolution in microbial ecology began in earnest with they first shotgun metagenomic sequencing of a marine virome \cite{Breitbart2002}.
That metagenome, sequenced with Sanger sequencing technology, was a modest 1.28 Mbp \cite{Breitbart2002}.
The first shotgun sequenced metagenomes of cellular life from the Sargasso Sea \cite{Venter2004} and the Iron Mountain acid mine drainage \cite{Tyson2004} added 265 Mbp and 76 Mbp respectively to the public databanks.
Since the availability of next generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, the volume of data has increased exponentially and is continuing to rise.
To put it in perspective, a single sample from the Antarctic lake datasets described in this thesis sequenced by the Roche GS-FLX titanium sequencer is 140 Mbp, while a recent study using Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencing of a marine sample \cite{Iverson2012} analysed 55,000 Mbp -- close to 400 times the amount of data.
This illustrates how sequencing technology is advancing so quickly that each new study has to develop new ways of looking into the microbial milieu captured in the particular sample.
%The benefits of using high-throughput sequencing technologies means that shotgun metagenomics will continue to be used as tool in the foreseeable future.
%But it also means overcoming tough analytical challenges that comes with it.

With higher throughput and falling costs of sequencing, genomic projects are finding analytical bottle necks are occuring in computational analysis.
This is because availability of computational resources and scaling-up of algorithms to accomodate multiple genomes or computing clusters is not occurring as quickly as the amount of sequencing.
Metagenomic sequencing projects typically entail a computationally intensive \acs{BLAST}-like comparisons before biological interpretations can be made.
Local cluster computing has thus far been the `go-to' way to process metagenomic datasets. 
However, acquiring the necessary computational resources can work out more costly for groups expecting only sporadic use.
This has been addressed to some extent by availibility of webserver pipelines specialised in metagenomic processing such as \ac{MG-RAST} \cite{Meyer2008} and \ac{CAMERA} \cite{Sun2011} for cellular metagenomes, as well as \textsc{Metavir} \cite{Roux2011} and \textsc{VIROME} \cite{Wommack2012} for viral metagenomes.
These webservers take on the burden of maintaining the programs and hosting the databases as well as providing computational power.
However, these workflows are generally not customisble if the user's needs fall too far outside of that provided. 
Further, processing massive datasets may still take an unfeasibly long time depending on the capabilites of the webserver.
Cloud computing resources look to be a promising way to make up the shortfall in computational power needed.
Depending of the expected volume of data and the frequency of analysis, hiring the use of cloud computing resources can prove cheaper than investing and maintaining a local cluster \cite{Anguioli2007}.

% Limitations of bioinformatic tools themselves.Gene prediction needs to get better. de novo assembly, binning.
%De novo assembly need to improve to be able to tackle highly diverse populations.
% Having high sequencing depth, a simple target population
% Could a metagenome ever be really `closed' metagenome, unless it is the most simple community, it seems difficult to imagine.

Aside from the computational limitations, `-omics' type analyses rely a great deal on current sequence databases and laboratory studies to make meaningful inferences.
For example, detection of the \ac{OLV} was contingent on the presence of a sufficiently close relative, Sputnik \cite{LaScola2008}, to the \ac{NR}.
%However, a large proportion of metagenomic sequence from viruses have no matches in any sequence databases and thus are not assignable to taxonomic or functional groups \cite{Lopez-Bueno2009}.
Similarly, sequencing and characterisation of \ac{DMSP} lyase genes over the last six years \cite{Johnston2008} allowed for them to be detected in Organic Lake.
A dependency on sequence databases applies even more to metaproteomic analysis.
Identification of proteins only indicates that they are expressed, but characterisation of the same or closely related protein is still necessary to infer its function in the sample.
This exemplifies how both metagenomics and metaproteomics need to be paired with basic laboratory studies.
Unlike metagenomics where fairly distantly related sequences can be matched to a metagenome to give some idea of its biological significance, spectral matching fails if protein sequences with high identity to those in the sample are not available.
This makes metaproteomics much more reliant on sequence database availibility and accuracy.

As mentioned above, future `-omic' studies need to now encompass longer time scales and a finer resolution of the populations and individuals within them.
This will allow for relationships to become apparent between molecular data and environmental parameters over space and time.
Pairing `-omics' tools with complementary techniques designed to target specific individuals or populations, community functions and biogeochemical processes is a promising way to enable an even deeper understanding of ecosystems by combining their respective strengths.
The hypotheses built on environmental data can then guide laboratory research studies and thus feedback into supporting a systems-level understanding of microbial communities.

\section{Concluding remarks}

This thesis has demonstrated how metagenomics and metaproteomics can be used as a tool for characterising Antarctic lake ecosystems.
The \textsc{DNA} sequence and mass spectra data that has been produced form a lasting record of the state of the microbial communities at the point in time that they were collected.
It thus acts as a resource against which other datasets can be compared to gain an understanding variability between ecosystems and as a bench mark to gauge changes overtime.
%The data can also be specifically mined to recover features of interest, for example sequences that encode enzymes with desired activities or bioactive compounds can be recovered by synthesis from the sequence information.
As sequence databases grow and more of the microbial world is characterised, this archive of molecular data can be re-analysed to learn even more from these unique ecosystems.
