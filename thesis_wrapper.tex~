\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Co-authorship Statement}
Some chapters or sections in this thesis have been published or submitted for publication in 
peer-reviewed journals. 
Copies of these publications are included in the Appendices.
Where I appear as the first author, I performed the majority of the research presented and wrote the 
manuscript. 
Contributions provided by others are detailled below and proceeding each chapter.
Where I appear as a secondary author, the thesis chapter contains only my contribution to the 
manuscript and background information to relate the findings to the objectives of this thesis.

Sections of Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} have been published in \textit{FEMS Microbiology Reviews} as: 
David Wilkins, Sheree Yau, Timothy Williams, Michelle Allen, Mark V. Brown, Matthew Z. DeMaere, 
Federico M. Lauro, and Ricardo Cavicchioli 
`Key Microbial Drivers in Antarctic Aquatic Environments'.
I contributied the section of the publication entitled \emph{Antarctic Lakes} 
excluding the subsection, 
\emph{Microbial mats as microcosms of Antarctic life}.
The majority of this is contained in Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} as 
\emph{Molecular insights into Antarctic lakes} \ref{in:mol}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:olv} has been published in 
\textit{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA} as: 
Sheree Yau, Federico M. Lauro, Matthew Z. DeMaere, Mark V. Brown, Torsten Thomas, 
Mark J. Raftery, Cynthia Andrews-Pfannkoch, Matthew Lewis, Jeffery M. Hoffman, John A. Gibson, and 
Ricardo Cavicchioli `Virophage control of antarctic algal host--virus dynamics'. 
The author contributions are described in the publication as: 
``F.M.L, M.V.B, T.T., J.A.G, and R.C. designed research; 
S.Y., F.M.L., M.Z.D., M.V.B., T.T., J.M.H., and R.C. performed research; 
M.J.R., C.A.-P.,M.L., and J.M.H. contributed reagents/analytical tools; 
S.Y., F.M.L., M.Z.D., and M.V.B. analyzed data; 
and S.Y., F.M.L., and R.C. wrote the paper.''
Specific details of research and analysis performed by others is as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample collection performed by F.M.L, M.V.B., T.T., J.M.H., and R.C.
\item DNA extraction and clone library generation of 2006 samples performed by C.A.-P., M.L., and 
J.M.H of the J. Craig Venter Institute.
\item DNA sequencing and quality control performed by M.L. of the J. Craig Venter Institute.
\item Metagenomic sequence quality control performed by F.M.L. and M.Z.D.
\item Global metagenomic sequence assembly and annotation performed by M.Z.D.
\item Preliminary taxonomic analysis performed by M.Z.D., and T.T.
\item Assistance in mass spectronomy and mass spectra analysis from M.J.R.
\item Eucaryal ribosomal subunit database construction and assistance in analysis by M.V.B.
\end{itemize}

Chapter~\ref{ch:ace} has been published in 
\textit{ISME Journal} as:
Federico M. Lauro, Matthew Z. DeMaere, Sheree Yau, Mark V. Brown, Charmaine Ng, David Wilkins, 
Mark J. Raftery, John A.E. Gibson, Cynthia Andrews-Pfannkoch, Matthew Lewis, Jeffery M. Hoffman,
Torsten Thomas, and Ricardo Cavicchioli
`An integrative study of a meromictic lake ecosystem in Antarctica'.
I performed the metaproteomic analysis of the whole lake, epifluorescence imaging, 
microbial and viral counts and wrote the corresponging sections of the manuscript.
