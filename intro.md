#Chapter 1: General Introduction - molecular microbial ecology of Antarctic aquatic ecosystems

##Why study Antarctic microbial ecosystems?
The Antarctica is a "cold desert" defined by constant low temperatures, little precipitation and long polar light cycles where only specially adapted organisms can survive.
Life is concentrated on the few ice-free coastal oases where liquid water is present in hundreds of lakes and ponds.
These include the Vestfold Hills, Bunger Hills, Larsemann Hills, Syowa Oasis, Schirmacher Oasis, Grearson Hills and McMurdo Dry Valleys in East Antarctica, the West Antarctic Peninsula and the sub-antarctic islands. 
Lake biota is dominated by microbial life where metazoans are rare or absent.
Antarctic lakes span a wide range of physical and chemical properties from freshwater to hypersaline, ice-covered to permanently melted and stratified or mixed.
Most lakes are largely isolated due to long periods of ice-cover and only receive intermittent external inputs from precipitation, glacial melt and in some cases marine incursion or animals.
Permanently ice-covered lakes and the bottom waters of meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes are truly closed systems with some lakes having been isolated for thousands to millions of years. Eg. Lakes in the Dry Valleys, subglacial lakes.

Microbial communities in Antarctic lakes have reduced diversity and richness with shortened food webs.
As a result, microbial processes are closely linked to lake geochemistry.
As the lakes span a continuum of different environmental parameters, they present themselves as "natural laboratories" where comparisons can be made between lakes that vary in a property of interest.
For example, lakes of different trophic statuses or salinities can be compared to determine adaptations to those environmental constraints. 
This makes Antarctic lakes ideal model ecosystems where it is possible to define the microbial community and infer the role members play within the system.
Meromictic lakes similarly provide a unique opportunity to compare between the discrete zones within a single lake. 
The relative isolation and extreme conditions of Antarctic lakes makes them potential reservoirs of novel taxa or refuges for ancient life. 
This study focuses on the microbial ecology of two meromictic lakes, Organic Lake and Ace Lake located in the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica.


##The Vestfold Hills
The Vestfold Hills is a rocky ice-free region of approximately 400 km^2 on the eastern shore of the Prydz Bay, Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica (fig:vestfold map) \cite{Gibson1999}. 
It is the region surrounding Davis Station in the Australian Antarctic Territory (lat.long.).
It is a temperate region and an important breeding ground for Adelie penguins, snow petrels etc (reference).

##Palaeogeography of the Vestfold Hills and the evolution of the lakes
The region was formed approximately 10,000 years ago when the retreat of the continental ice-shelf lead to isostatic uplift of the land \cite{Burton1981}. 
Water was trapped in the exposed rocky depressions forming the hundreds (how many?) of lakes and ponds(Zwartz?).
Those lakes that are nearer to the coast were formed from seawater and are predominantly saline or hypersaline (Burke 1988).
Freshwater lakes near the continental ice shelf were likely already above sea-level as the ice receded are not marine-derived (Laybourne-Parry 1992, Bronge 1996).
Lakes closer to the coast, such as Rookery Lake, may still occasionally experience marine inputs while those further inland have completely separated from the sea with most lakes generally <6,000 years old \cite:{Burton1981}. (Ages of the lakes?)
All lakes may receive water inputs from precipitation, from the ice-shelf and glacial melt streams \cite:{Burton1981}.
Since their formation each lake has followed a separate physical evolution depending on the local geography and now have very different chemical and physical properties. 
Some have experience negative water balances and have concentrated by ablation (evaporation and sublimnation) to become hypersaline (reference).
While other originally saline lakes have been flushed with glacial melt water and have become fresh eg. Clear Lake (Pickard 1986, Bird 1991).
Nutrient status? (see Burton 1981)
temperature?
weather?
major ions? (see Burton1981)
This is the largest concentration of meromictic lakes in Antarctica (Gibson 1999) in the world (number?).

##Insights From Molecular-based Studies of other Antarctic aquatic terrestrial
-Most study sites have used 16S or 18S rRNA gene cloning, DGGE or FISH. 
-Next generation studies have not been implemented.
-Have studied various lakes
-Have found that for some systems there is no ifference between littoral vs limnetic zones.
-Can associate eutrophia with key taxa.
-Can complete the Nutrient cycle in blood falls.

##Key biota in the other lakes
How similar are they to the systems we're looking at?

##Limitations of previous studies
Culture dependent
don't look at a broad breadth of the community
ignore viruses

##Metagenomics and Metaproteomic approaches

##Objectives
Overall, this study aimed to use metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches to gain an integrative understanding of the Ace and Organic Lake ecosystems.
Using this methodology, not only can the taxonomic composition of the lakes be determined but also the functional potential of the microbial population and insight into the active members of the community.
The objectives of the research were:

1) To determine the microbial and viral composition of the lake communities.

2) To determine the functional potential of the lake biota.

3) To reconstruct as much genomic information as possible of dominant taxa and to infer their physiology and ecological role.

4) To integrate environmental and biological data and model the lake microbial interactions and geochemical processes.
