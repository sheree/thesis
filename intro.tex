\section{Chapter 1: General Introduction - molecular microbial ecology of Antarctic lake ecosystems}

\subsection{Introduction}

Antarctica is a ``frozen desert'' of constant low temperature, little precipitation and long polar light cycles where only specially adapted organisms can survive.
Only 0.4\% of the total ice area of Antarctica ($12.3 × 10^6 km^2$) is seasonally ice-free, comprising exposed mountains and coastal areas%ref.
Life is concentrated on the few ice-free coastal oases where liquid water is present in hundreds of lakes and ponds. 
Antarctic lakes span a wide range of physical and chemical properties from freshwater to hypersaline, ice-covered to perenially melted and permanently stratified (meromictic) to mixed (holomictic).
Most lakes are largely isolated due to long periods of ice-cover, and may be truly closed systems if ice-cover is permanent as in subglacial lakes. 
The age of water varies considerably, with the subglacial outflow from Blood Falls estimated to be 1.5 million years old \cite{Mickucki, 2009}, the water in Ace Lake about ~5000 years old \cite{Rankin1999}, and Lake Miers water less than 300 years old \cite{Green1988}. 
Organisms inhabiting the lakes may be examples of ancient life or undiscovered endemic species.
Lake biota is microbially dominated with few or no metazoans present \cite{Laybourne-Parry1997}.
The reduced complexity means it is possible to encompass a large proportion of the diversity present through the use of molecular-based techniques.
The lakes inhabit a continuum of environmental factors, presenting themselves as ``natural laboratories'' where comparisons can be made between lakes that vary in a property of interest. 
Meromictic lakes similarly provide an opportunity to describe microbial populations along chemical gradients, but within a single water body. 
This makes Antarctic lakes ideal model ecosystems to examine microbial influence on geochemistry by relating taxa to particular processes\cite{Laybourne-Parry2007}.

This introduction will describe the Antarctic Coastal Oases, the Vestfold Hills study site; particularly Organic and Ace Lakes, which were the focus of this thesis, and review the microbial ecology of Antarctic lake systems. 
Since this thesis was undertaken using random sequencing of environmental DNA (metagenomics) and identification of environmental proteins (metaproteomics), detailled review is restricted to molecular-based studies.

\subsection{Antarctic Coastal Oases and glacial lakes}

Perenially available liquid water is confined to coastal lakes, subglacial and epiglacial lakes.
Subglacial and epiglacial lakes also appear to be prevalent in Antarctica with at least 145 subglacial lakes identified \cite{Siegert2005}.%check (Gibson, 2006; Cavicchioli, 2007; Pearce, 2009). 
Much less is known about these systems as they are difficult to access.
Coastal oases where lakes are found include the Vestfold Hills, Bunger Hills, Larsemann Hills, Syowa Oasis, Schirmacher Oasis, Grearson Hills and McMurdo Dry Valleys in East Antarctica, the West Antarctic Peninsula and the sub-antarctic islands.
Of these, the best studied in terms of the lakes are those of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, The Vestfold Hills and the subantarctic islands.
These regions are characterised by rocks, penguins and tend to be near the research bases.
People have been visiting these areas on and off for a few decades, so some lakes are relatively well studied, but the vast majority are not.

\subsection{The Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica}

The Vestfold Hills is a rocky ice-free region of approximately 400 km\^{}2 on the eastern shore of the Prydz Bay, East Antarctica (fig:vestfold map) \cite{Gibson1999}.
It surrounds Davis Station in the Australian Antarctic Territory (68°33'S, 78°15'E). 
The Australian Antarctic Data Centre lists more than 3000 water bodies mapped in the Vestfold Hills, ranging in area from 1 to 8,757,944 m\^{}2.
More than 300 lakes and ponds have been described, including ~20\% of the world's meromictic lakes \cite{Gibson, 1999}. 
Fjords connected to the ocean also cut across the Vestfold Hills. 
Some of these are large, such as Ellis Fjord which is 10 km long, up to 100 m deep and has become a stratified system due to its restricted opening to the ocean \cite{Burke1988}.
The region was formed approximately 10,000 years ago when the retreat of the continental ice-shelf lead to isostatic uplift of the land \cite{Burton1981}. 
The lakes origated from water trapped in the exposed rocky depressions.
Many of the coastal lakes are marine-derived, having been separated from the marine environment ~3,000–7,000 years ago \cite{Gibson1999} and are predominantly saline or hypersaline \cite{Burke1988}.
The latter are formed due to concentrated by ablation (evaporation and sublimnation).%(reference). 
Freshwater lakes near the continental ice shelf were likely already above sea-level as the ice receded and are not marine-derived \cite{Laybourne-Parry1992} \cite{Bronge1996}.
Lakes closer to the coast, such as Rookery Lake, may still occasionally experience marine inputs although most have completely separated from the sea.%ref
All lakes may receive water inputs from precipitation, from the ice-shelf and glacial melt streams \cite{Burton1981}. 
This can cause freshwater to seasonaly overlay some saline lakes as the ice-cover thaws.
Glacial meltwater flushing has lead some lakes that were originally marine-derived, such as Clear Lake, to become fresh \cite{Pickard1986}\cite{Bird1991}.

Since their formation each lake has followed a separate physical evolution depending on the local geography and now have very different chemical and physical properties.

\subsection{Molecular approaches used in Antarctic lake systems}

The majority of molecular-based studies of Antarctic aquatic microbial communities have made use of PCR amplification of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences to survey the diversity of Bacteria and in some cases Archaea and Eucarya (Table 1).%table
Microbial composition has been determined by cloning and sequencing of rRNA gene amplicons exclusively (Bowmanet al., 2000a; Bowman et al., 2000b; Gordon et al., 2000; Christner et al., 2001; Purdy et al., 2003; Karr et al., 2006;Matsuzaki et al., 2006; Kurosawa et al., 2010;Bielewicz et al., 2011), although most studies have also made use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to provide a molecular ‘fingerprint’ of the community (Pearce, 2003; Pearce et al., 2003; Karr et al., 2005; Pearce, 2005; Pearce et al., 2005; Unrein et al., 2005; Glatz et al., 2006; Mikucki & Priscu, 2007; Mosier et al., 2007; Schiaffino et al., 2009; Villaescusa, 2010).
Functional genes have also been targeted using PCR amplification to assess the potential of biochemical processes occurring, such as nitrogen fixation (Olsen et al., 1998), ammonia oxidation (Voytek et al., 1999), anoxygenic photosynthesis (Karr et al., 2003), and dissimilatory sulfite reduction (Karr et al., 2005; Mikucki et al., 2009). %add in new studies
Metagenomic studies have assessed both the taxonomic composition and genetic potential of lake communities, and in some cases have linked function to specific members of the community(Lopez-Bueno et al., 2009; Ng et al., 2010; Lauro et al., 2011; Yau et al., 2011; Varin et al., 2012).%how to fit your work in??
When coupled with functional “omic” techniques (to date metaproteomics has been applied, but not metatranscriptomics or stable isotope probing), information has also been gained about the genetic complement that has been expressed by the resident populations (Ng et al., 2010; Lauro et al., 2011; Yau et al., 2011).

\subsection{Insights from molecular studies of Antarctic aquatic systems}

\subsection{Bacterial diversity defined by salinity}
The vast majority of molecular studies of Antarctic lakes have focused on bacteria.
Consistent with the wide range of physical and chemical properties of Antarctic lakes, a large variation in species assemblages have been found.
While exchange of microorganisms must be able to occur between lakes that are in close vicinity to each other, the picture that has emerged from the data to date is that microbial populations arerelatively unique to each type of isolated system. 
Nonetheless, certain trends in bacterial composition are also apparent.
Focusing on the similarities, lakes of equivalent salinities tend to have similar communities.
Hypersaline lakes from the Vestfold Hills (Bowman et al., 2000b) and McMurdo Dry Valleys (Glatz et al., 2006; Mosier et al., 2007) were all dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group (= Bacteroidetes) as well as harboring lower abundance populations of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes.
The surface waters of saline lakes resemble marine communities dominated by CFB, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, but divisions such as Actinobacteria and specific clades of Cyanobacteria have been found to be overrepresented compared to the ocean (Lauro et al., 2011).
Sediments from saline lakes in the Vestfold Hills (Bowman et al., 2000a) and Nuramake-Ike in the Syowa Oasis (Kurasawa et al., 2010) were very similar, containing in addition to the surface clades, Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Chloroflexi (green non-sulfur bacteria), Verrucomicrobia and representatives of candidate divisions.
Plankton from freshwater lakes were characterized by an abundance of Betaproteobacteria, although Actinobacteria, CFB-group, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were also prominent (Pearce et al., 2003; Pearce, 2005; Pearce et al., 2005; Schiaffino et al., 2009). 

\subsection{Bacterial diversity defined by nutrients}
Differences in bacterial community structure are also influenced by nutrient availability.
In studies of freshwater lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, cluster analysis of DGGE profiles grouped together lakes of similar trophic status (Schiaffino et al., 2009; Villaescusa et al., 2010).
Most of the variance in community structure could be explained by related chemical parameters such as phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Similarly, three freshwater lakes, Moss, Sombre and Heywood on Signy Island are alike except that Heywood Lake is enriched by organic inputs from seals.
Bacterial composition in each lake changed from winter to summer and this was again correlated to variation in physico-chemical properties (Pearce, 2005). 
The bacterial population of Heywood Lake had shifted from a dominance of Cyanobacteria towards a greater abundance of Actinobacteria and marine Alphaproteobacteria (Pearce et al., 2005).
This hints at a link between a copiotrophic lifestyle in the Heywood Lake Actinobacteria and inhibition of Antarctic freshwater Cyanobacteria by eutrophication. 
This type of study exemplifies how inferences can be made about taxa and function by examining population changes over time and over gradients of environmental parameters.


\subsection{Bacterial diversity: biogeography}
The relative isolation and diverse chemistries of the lakes facilitates biogeographical and biogeochemical studies. 
The anoxic and sulfidic bottom waters of some meromictic lakes form due to a density gradient that precludes mixing. 
Although sedimentation from the upper aerobic waters may occur, there is little opportunity for interchange of species with the bottom water of lakes allowing for greater divergence in community composition as nutrients can become depleted and products of metabolism can accumulate.
As a result, distinct distributions of bacterial groups can inhabit these strata, and different types of microorganisms can be found in equivalent strata in different lakes. A good example of this is the presence of common types of purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiales)and green sulfur bacteria (GSB, = Chlorobi) in some meromictic lakes and stratified fjords in the Vestfold Hills (Burke & Burton, 1988), compared to diverse “purple non-sulfur bacteria" in Lake Fryxell in Victoria Land (Karr et al., 2003). 
In Lake Bonney, the east and west lobes harbor overlapping but distinct communities in the suboxic waters (Glatz et al., 2006).
The east lobe was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and the west lobe by CFB, illustrating how divergent communities can form from the same seed population. 
In contrast, ice communities are more readily dispersed by wind, aerosols and melt-water and 16S rRNA gene probes designed from bacteria trapped in the permanent ice-cover of Lake Bonney hybridized to microbial mat libraries sourced up to 15 km away (Gordon et al., 2000).
This demonstrates how a single lake may encompass microorganisms that are geographically dispersed, while also harboring others that have restricted niches and are under stronger selection pressure.

Subglacial systems, such as Lake Vostok, have been isolated from the open environment for hundreds of thousands to millions of years (Siegert et al., 2001).
As a result they provide a reservoir of microorganisms that may have undergone significant evolutionary divergence from the same seed populations that were not isolated by the Antarctic ice cover. 
The uniqueness of these types of systems also creates a conundrum for studying them. 
Lake Vostok is approximately 4 km below the continental ice-sheet making it extremely difficult to determine suitable means for accessing the lake without inadvertently contaminating it with biological (e.g. surface microorganisms) or chemical (e.g. drilling fluid) matter (Inman 2005; Wingham et al., 2006; Lukin &Bulat 2011; Gramling, 2012; Jones, 2012). 
To date, molecular microbial studies have concentrated on the accretion ice above the ice-water interface (Priscu et al., 1999;Christner et al., 2000).
Accretion ice has been found to contain a low density of bacterial cells from Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and CFB divisions closely allied to other cold environments.
Molecular signatures of a thermophilic Hydrogenophilu sspecies were also identified in accretion ice raising the possibility that chemoautotrophic thermophiles were delivered to the accretion ice from hydrothermal areas in the lake’s bedrock (Bulat et al., 2004; Lavire et al., 2007).
However, interpretation of results from samples sourced from the Lake Vostok bore hole are very challenging as it is difficult to differentiate contaminants from native Vostok microorganisms.
From a study that assessed possible contaminants present in hydrocarbon-based drilling fluid retrieved from the Vostok ice core bore hole, six phylotypes were designated as new contaminants (Alekhina et al., 2007). 
Two of these were Sphingomonas phylotypes essentially identical to those found in the accretion ice-core (Christner et al., 2000) which raises question about whether bacterial signatures identified from the ice-cores are representative of Lake Vostok water, and further highlights the ongoing problem of causing forward contamination into the lake.

\subsection{Archaea: methanogens and haloarchaea}
Archaea have been detected mainly in anoxic sediments and bottom waters from lakes that range in salinity from fresh to hypersaline, and those with known isolates are affiliated with methanogens or haloarchaea (Bowman et al., 2000a; Bowman et al., 2000b; Purdy et al., 2003; Kurasawa et al., 2010; Lauro et al., 2011).%relate how this is different to marine deep waters
Anoxia allows for the growth of methanogenic archaea that mineralize fermentation products such as acetate, and H2 and CO2 into methane, thereby performing an important step in carbon cycling.
The acetoclastic methanogens thrive in environments where alternative terminal electron acceptors such as sulfate and nitrate have been depleted. 
One example of this is Lake Heywood where methanogenic archaea were found to comprise 34\% of the total microbial population in the freshwater sediment, the majority of which were Methanosarcinales which include acetate and C1-compound utilizing methanogens (Purdy et al., 2003). 
Both H2:CO2 (Methanogenium frigidum) and methylamine/methanol (Methanococcoides burtonii) utilizing methanogens were isolated from Ace Lake (Franzmann et al., 1992, 1997) providing opportunities for genomic analyses (Saunders et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2009) and a host of studies addressing molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation (e.g. Cavicchioli, 2006; Williams et al.,2011).
In general, archaeal populations appear to be adapted to their specific lake environment.
Sediments from saline lakes of the Vestfold Hills were inhabited by members of the Euryarchaeota typically found in sediment and marine environments with the phylotypes differing between the lakes examined (Bowman et al., 2000a). 
While a phylotype similar to Methanosarcina was identified, the majority were highly divergent. 
Similarly, Methanosarcina and Methanoculleus were detected in Lake Fryxell but other members of the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota (a single sequence) were divergent, clustering only with marine clones (Karr et al., 2006). 
Based on the lake chemical gradients and the location of these novel phylotypes in the water column the authors speculated these archaea may be have alternative metabolisms such as anoxic methanotrophy or sulfur-utilization. 
In sediments from Lake Nurume-Ike in the Langhovde region, 205 archaeal clones grouped into three phylotypes, with the predominant archaeal clone being related to a clone from Burton Lake in the Vestfold Hills, while the other two did not match to any cultivated species (Kurasawa et al., 2010). 
Consistent with these observations, from a metagenomic study that involved the analysis of ~9 million genes, a high level of divergence was found for the archaea present in the bottom waters of Ace Lake; the majority of which did not match to known methanogens including M. frigidum and M. burtonii that were isolated from the lake (Lauro et al., 2011). 
However, high levels of methane are present in Ace Lake bottom waters and this is likely to have been produced gradually by the methanogenic community, and retained in the lake due to the very low potentialfor aerobic methane oxidation and the apparent absence of anaerobic methane oxidizing (ANME)Euryarchaeota (Lauro et al., 2011).
In hypersaline lakes where bottom waters do not become completely anoxic, methanogens are not present and archaea have extremely low abundance. 
For example, only two archeael clones of the same phylotype were recovered from deep water samples from Lake Bonney (Glatz et al., 2006), and Organic Lake in the Vestfold Hills had an extremely low abundance of archaeal clones related to Halobacteriales (Bowman et al., 2000b). 
In contrast to these stratified hypersaline lakes, the microbial community in the extremely hypersaline Deep Lake isdominated by haloarchaea (Bowman et al., 2000b). 
Many of the clones identified from Deep Lake are similar to Halorubrum (formerly Halobacterium) lacusprofundi which was isolated from the lake (Franzmann et al., 1988). 

\subsection{Eucarya perform multiple ecosystem roles}

Single-celled Eucarya are important members of Antarctic aquatic microbial communities.
In many Antarctic systems, eucaryal algae are the main photosynthetic organisms and in others, only heterotrophic protists occupy the top trophic level. 
As eucaryal cells are generally large with characteristic morphologies, microscopic identifications have been used. 
However, microscopy is unable to classify smaller cells such as nanoflagellates with high resolution, although these may constitute a high proportion of algal biomass.
For example, five morphotypes of Chrysophyceae, evident in Antarcticlakes were unidentifiable by light microscopy but were able to be classified using DGGE and DNA sequencing (Unrein et al., 2005).
Consistent with this, molecular studies specifically targeting eucaryal diversity (Unrein et al., 2005; Mosier et al., 2007; Bielewicz et al., 2011) have identified a much higher level of diversity than previously suspected, and the studies have discovered lineages not previously known to be present such as silicoflagellates (Unrein et al., 2005) and fungi (Mosier et al., 2007; Bielewicz et al., 2011).

Most eucarya in Antarctic lakes are photosynthetic microalgae that are present in marine environments with a wide distribution including chlorophytes, haptophytes, cryptophytes and bacillariophytes.
Molecular methods have afforded deeper insight into the phylogenetic diversity within these broader divisions and have revealed some patterns in their distribution. 
Using 18S rRNA gene amplification and DGGE, the same chrysophyte phylotypes were identified in lakes from the Antarctic Peninsula and King George Island despite being 220 km apart (Unrein et al., 2005) indicating these species may be well-adapted to Antarctica or highly dispersed.
Similarly, an unknown stramenopile sequence was detected throughout the 18S rRNA clone libraries of Lake Bonney demonstrating a previously unrecognized taxon occupied the entire photic zone in the lake (Bielewicz et al., 2011). 
In constrast, other groups showed distinct vertical and temporal distributions with cryptophytes dominating the surface, haptophytes the midwaters and chlorophytes the deeper layers during the summer while stramenopiles increased in the winter (Bielewicz et al., 2011). 
Further studies are necessary to determine the basis for apparent specific adaptations of some species to particular lakes or lake strata, and for the cosmopolitan distribution of others.
Here, molecular based research of the kind that has been applied to bacteria such as functional gene surveys will undoubtedly help answer these questions.

\subsection{Limitations of previous studies}
Inferring functional potential from taxonomic surveys can be problematic due to species or strain level differences in otherwise related bacteria.
For example, the majority of the Gammaproteobacteria in hypersaline lakes were relatives of Marinobacter suggesting that this genus is particularly adapted to hypersaline systems (Bowman et al., 2000b; Glatz et al., 2006; Matsuzaki et al., 2006; Mosier et al., 2007).
Nonetheless, Marinobacter species from different lakes appeared biochemically distinct as isolates from hypersaline lake Suribati-Ike were all able to respire dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) but not nitrate (Matsuzaki et al., 2006). 
In contrast, those from the west lobe of Lake Bonney were all able to respire nitrate (Ward & Priscu, 1997). 
Interestingly, in the east lobe of the same lake, nitrate respiration was inhibited although a near-identical Marinobacter phylotype was present; it was speculated that the inhibition may have been caused by an as yet unidentified chemical factor (Ward et al., 2005; Glatz et al., 2006). 

This also applies to Eucarya, as the influence of flagellates on ecosystem function is not necessarily clear-cut as they can simultaneously inhabit several trophic levels. 
For instance, in Ace Lake the mixotrophic phytoflagellate Pyramimonasgelidocola derives a proportion of its carbon intake through bacterivory (Bell & Laybourn-Parry, 2003) but in the nearby Highway Lake, it uptakes dissolved organic carbon (Laybourn-Parry et al., 2005). 
This again illustrates potential limitations for deriving ecosystem level functions from taxonomic studies alone, even with taxa that appear physiologically straightforward. 



\subsection{Objectives}

Overall, this study aimed to use metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches to gain an integrative understanding of the Ace and Organic Lake ecosystems. 
Using this methodology, not only can the taxonomic composition of the lakes be determined but also the functional potential of the microbial population and insight into the active members of the community.
The objectives of the research were:

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item
  To determine the microbial and viral composition of the lake
  communities.

\item
  To determine the functional potential of the lake biota.

\item
  To reconstruct as much genomic information as possible of dominant taxa and to infer their physiology and ecological role.

\item
  To integrate environmental and biological data and model the lake microbial interactions and geochemical processes.

\end{enumerate}
