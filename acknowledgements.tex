%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
First of all, thanks to my supervisor, Rick Cavicchioli, and my co-supervisor, Federico Lauro.
Without their support, useful discussions, editorial assistance and much needed prods along throughout the course of my PhD, I certainly would not have gotten this done or come anywhere near as far.
I am very grateful for the time, energy, patience and hard work that was put into me.
I have learnt a lot!

Thanks to my family in the lab, from whom I have also learnt a lot and who have been wonderful friends to work with.
Tim Williams, Mark Brown and Matt DeMaere deserve a special mention for their help, advice and support on the projects.
Very special thanks go to David Wilkins and Suhaila Mohd. Omar, who have worked alongside with me as fellow PhD companions and without whom I would have been lost.
Thanks to Jodi Richards, Tim Charlton, Sohail Siddhiqui and Haluk Ertan, for the invaluable lunchtime support group meetings.
Thanks to the past PhD students in the group, Charmaine Ng, Dominic Burg and Davide De Francisci, who left big footprints for me to follow.
Thanks to my extended university family, Jo and Malu, for being my much needed tea and lunch break companions, and Kylie and Pan, for all the mind-expanding biology discussions.

To my at-home science family, thanks for being there as my constant, private support team and my human/non-human pack to run through life with.
Very special thanks to Amy Cain, who has been through the whole gamut of education with me until this point where all the official avenues of higher learning have been exhausted, and to Laura Nolan, who has ended up as good as a de facto wife as well as thesis sister.
Thanks to Julia Suurbach, Meaghan Kukulj, Sissy Reyes and Sophia Slavich for being such good friends and inspiring women to be around.
Thanks to Rosko, Mutley, Puggy, Calypso, Icarus, Nakita I and II for the much needed walks, fly-arounds and just hanging around as part of the family.

A very special thanks to my genetic family without whom I definitely would not have been here to do this.
Thanks mum, pop and Jerson, I owe you everything.
Thanks Indy (I know we are only very distantly related really, but it doesn't matter).
