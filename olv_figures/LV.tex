(\textbf{A}) Time course of host (red line) and \ac{OLPV} (blue line) populations in the absence of \ac{OLV}. 
(\textbf{B}) Orbit plot between host and \ac{OLPV} populations in the absence of \ac{OLV} with the host and \ac{OLPV} populations approaching zero during an equilibrium cycle. 
(\textbf{C}) Time course describing the effect of the addition of \ac{OLV} (green line) on OLPV-host population dynamics as a predator of predator resulting in increased frequency of population ocillations and a higher minimal number of hosts and \acp{OLPV} (\textbf{D}) compared to in the absence of OLV (\textbf{B}). 
(\textbf{E}) The orbit plot of \ac{OLPV} and \ac{OLV} is also shown. 
Note that the time intervals are arbitrary.
